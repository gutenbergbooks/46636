<h2 class="eee">PREFACE</h2>
<p>The Study comprised in the following pages should,
as the title indicates, be regarded as an Appendix to
the Studies on the Lancelot Legend previously published
in the Grimm Library Series. As will be seen,
they not only deal with an adventure ascribed to that
hero, but also provide additional arguments in support
of the theory of romantic evolution there set forth.
Should the earlier volume ever attain to the honour of
a second edition, it will probably be found well to
include this Study in the form of an additional chapter;
but serious students of Arthurian romance are unfortunately
not so large a body that the speedy exhaustion
of an edition of any work dealing with the subject can
be looked for, and, therefore, as the facts elucidated
in the following pages are of considerable interest and
importance to all concerned in the difficult task of
investigating the sources of the Arthurian legend, it
has been thought well to publish them without delay
in their present form.</p>
<p>In the course of this Study I have, as opportunity
afforded, expressed opinions on certain points upon
which Arthurian scholars are at issue. Here in these
few introductory words I should like, if possible, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
make clear my own position with regard to the question
of Arthurian criticism as a whole. I shall probably
be deemed presumptuous when I say that, so far, I
very much doubt whether we have any one clearly
ascertained and established fact that will serve as a
definite and solid basis for the construction of a working
hypothesis as to the origin and development of
this immense body of romance. We all of us have
taken, and are taking, far too much for granted. We
have but very few thoroughly reliable critical editions,
based upon a comparative study of all the extant
manuscripts. Failing a more general existence of such
critical editions, it appears impossible to hope with any
prospect of success to &lsquo;place&rsquo; the various romances.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Further, it may be doubted if the true conditions
of the problem, or problems, involved have even yet
been adequately realised. The Arthurian cycle is not
based, as is the Charlemagne cycle, upon a solid substratum
of fact, which though modified for literary
purposes is yet more or less capable of identification
and rectification; such basis of historic fact as exists
is extremely small, and for critical purposes may practically
be restricted to certain definite borrowings from
the early chronicles.</p>
<p>The great body of Arthurian romance took shape
and form in the minds of a people reminiscent of past,
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
hopeful of future, glory, who interwove with their
dreams of the past, and their hopes for the future, the
current beliefs of the present. To thoroughly understand,
and to be able intelligently and helpfully to
criticise the Arthurian Legend, it is essential that
we do not allow ourselves to be led astray by what
we may call the &lsquo;accidents&rsquo; of the problem&mdash;the
moulding into literary shape under French influence&mdash;but
rather fix our attention upon the &lsquo;essentials&rsquo;&mdash;the
radically Celtic and folk-lore character of the material
of which it is composed.</p>
<p>We need, as it were, to place ourselves <i>en rapport</i>
with the mind alike of the conquered and the conquerors.
It is not easy to shake ourselves free from
the traditions and methods of mere textual criticism
and treat a question, which is after all more or less
a question of scholarship, on a wider basis than such
questions usually demand. Yet, unless I am much
mistaken, this adherence to traditional methods, and
consequent confusion between what is essential and
what merely accidental, has operated disastrously in
retarding the progress of Arthurian criticism; because
we have failed to realise the true character of the
material involved, we have fallen into the error of
criticising Arthurian romance as if its beginnings
synchronised more or less exactly with its appearance
in literary form. A more scientific method will, I
believe, before long force us to the conclusion that the
majority of the stories existed in a fully developed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
coherent, and what we may fairly call a romantic form
for a considerable period before they found literary
shape. We shall also, probably, find that in their
gradual development they owed infinitely less to independent
and individual imagination than they did
to borrowings from that inexhaustible stock of tales
in which all peoples of the world appear to have a
common share.</p>
<p>Thus I believe that the first two lessons which the
student of Arthurian romance should take to heart are
(<i>a</i>) the extreme paucity of any definite critical result,
(<i>b</i>) the extreme antiquity of much of the material with
which we are dealing.</p>
<p>But there is also a third point as yet insufficiently
realised&mdash;the historic factors of the problem. We hear
a great deal of the undying hatred which is supposed
to have existed between the Britons and their Saxon
conquerors; the historical facts, such as they are, have
been worked for all they are worth in the interests of
a particular school of criticism; but so far attention
has been but little directed to a series of at least equally
remarkable historic facts&mdash;the deliberate attempts
made to conciliate the conquered Britons by a dexterous
political use of their national beliefs and
aspirations.</p>
<p>In 1894, when publishing my first essay in Arthurian
criticism, the translation of Wolfram von Eschenbach&rsquo;s
<i>Parzival</i>, I drew attention to the very curious Angevin
allusions of that poem, and the definite parallels to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
traced between the incidents of the story and those
recorded in the genuine Angevin Chronicles. I then
hazarded the suggestion that many of the peculiarities
of this version might be accounted for by a desire on
the part of the author to compliment the most noted
prince of that house by drawing a parallel between the
fortunes of Perceval and his mother, Herzeleide, and
those of Henry of Anjou and his mother, the Empress
Maude. Subsequent study has only confirmed the
opinion then tentatively expressed; and I cannot but
feel strongly that the average method of criticism,
which contents itself merely with discussion of those
portions of Wolfram&rsquo;s poem which correspond to other
versions of the <i>Perceval</i> story, while it neglects those
sections (<i>i.e.</i> the Angevin allusions and the Grail
&lsquo;Templars&rsquo;) to which no parallel can be found elsewhere,
is a method which entirely defeats its own
object, and one from which only partial results can be
obtained.</p>
<p>For critical purposes, and for determining certain
central problems of the location and growth of the
Arthurian Legend in literary form, I doubt whether
the <i>Parzival</i> be not the most important extant text
of the entire cycle: once realise&mdash;as if we thoroughly
understand the historic conditions of the time we can
scarcely fail to realise&mdash;that those two first introductory
books could not possibly be written at the date of
the composition of the German poem, and we shall
then begin to recognise the extreme importance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
discovering the when, where, and why of their original
composition. Could we solve the riddle of the date
and authorship of the earlier poem, that containing the
Angevin allusions, the Grail Temple with its knights,
and, we may add, the numerous Oriental references, we
should, I believe, hold in our hand the master-key
which would unlock the main problems confronting us.
In all probability that unlocking when it comes will
furnish us with more than one surprise.</p>
<p>The Arthurian problem is one which appeals not
only to the literary critic but also to the historian.
Have we not in the past been tempted to regard it too
exclusively as the property of the one, and to hold that
a British chieftain of whose name and exploits such
scanty record survives can scarcely be a worthy subject
of serious historic research? But if the study of
history fails to elucidate much concerning the personality
and feats of Arthur, it may yet discover much
with regard to the growth and development of his
legend.</p>
<p>The Arthurian cycle, both in literary value and in
intrinsic interest, forms undoubtedly the most important
group in Medi&aelig;val literature. Is it not a reproach
to scholars that to-day, at the beginning of the
twentieth century, there should be such an utter lack
of knowledge of the proper order and relation of the
members of that group? The most brilliant Arthurian
scholars can offer us no more than an accurate
acquaintance with certain texts, and, perhaps, an
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
hypothesis as to their relative order. The result is
that a period extending over some fifty years or more
of unusual literary activity, and far-reaching influence,
lies at present outside the area of scientific knowledge,
and is, for teaching purposes, practically non-existent.
We cannot write the history of Arthurian literature,
we cannot teach or lecture with confidence upon any
portion of it, until a more determined and systematic
attempt at unravelling its many puzzles be made.</p>
<p>Is it not time to seriously consider the desirability of
co-ordinating the labours of individual scholars? At
present each works, as Hal o&rsquo; the Wynd fought, for his
own hand, and it is only by a happy chance that the
work of one supplements and supports that of another.
Is not the time ripe for the formation of an International
Society, composed of those students, in
France, Germany, America and England, who are
sincerely interested in the elucidation of this important
section of Medi&aelig;val literature, and who, working on
an organised and predetermined plan, shall co-operate
towards rendering possible the compilation of a really
accurate and scientific history of the Arthurian cycle?
Those who took a share, however small, in such a work
would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that
they were contributing, not to the ephemeral curiosity
or pleasure of the passing moment, but to the enduring
profit and permanent intellectual wealth of the world.</p>

<p class="lr"><i>Ipomedon</i>, fo. 82, ll. 29-30.</p>
</div>
<p>These words of the author of the <i>Ipomedon</i> were,
some years ago, commented upon by Mr. Ward in his
valuable <i>Catalogue of Romances in the British Museum</i>,
vol. i. He there remarks that the allusion is especially
valuable as being the direct ascription, by a contemporary,
of the character of romance-writer to Walter
Map, and that in apparent connection with the
romance most persistently attributed to him&mdash;the
<i>Prose Lancelot</i>.</p>
<p>The suggestive remarks of Mr. Ward do not appear
hitherto to have attracted the attention they deserve.
Recently, having occasion to write a brief notice of
Walter Map, they came, for the first time, under my
notice, and, taken in connection with certain points of
the <i>Lancelot</i> study in which I had for some time been
engaged, assumed an unexpected importance. It
became evident to me that the whole question of the
connection of the <i>Ipomedon</i> with Arthurian literature,
and the light which the words of the author might
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
throw upon the relation to each other of different forms
of the same story, was well worth study; and might
eventually be of material assistance in determining the
much debated question of the position of Chr&eacute;tien de
Troyes in the Arthurian cycle.</p>
<p>In the following pages I propose to examine, first,
the exact nature and value of the evidence of the <i>Ipomedon</i>
as regards Arthurian tradition; second, its bearing
upon the versions of a popular incident in romance&mdash;the
appearance of a knight at a tournament on three
consecutive days, in the disguise of three different suits
of armour&mdash;especially with relation to the versions of
the <i>Prose Lancelot</i>, the <i>Lanzelet</i> of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven,
and the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes.</p>
<p>To begin with the <i>Ipomedon</i>. As is probably known
to most scholars, the scene of this story is laid in the
south of Europe&mdash;Sicily, Calabria, Apulia&mdash;and the
names of the characters are largely borrowed from
classical sources. The poem relates at considerable
length the wooing of the Princess of Calabria, known
as <i>La Fi&egrave;re</i>, by Ipomedon, son of the King of Apulia.
(In the second part of the poem the hero&rsquo;s father is
dead, and he is, himself, king.) The lady has made
a vow to wed none but the bravest of knights.
Ipomedon, disguised as her cup-bearer, wins her love,
and at a three days&rsquo; tournament, in a varying
armour of white, red, and black, wins her hand, but
disappears without claiming it, under the pretext that
he has not won sufficient fame to satisfy her pride.
In the second part of the poem the lady is threatened
by an unwelcome suitor, in the person of a hideous
giant. Ipomedon, aware of her plight, disguises himself
as a fool, and goes to her uncle&rsquo;s court, knowing
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
that she will send thither for aid. He demands from
the king the gift of the first combat that shall offer,
which is granted as a mere joke. On the appearance
of the messenger sent by <i>La Fi&egrave;re</i>&mdash;the favourite
friend of the princess&mdash;Ipomedon claims the fulfilment
of the king&rsquo;s pledge, much to the disgust of the
maiden, who will have nothing to do with him at
first, but whose confidence he wins by his valiant
deeds on the journey, defeats and slays the giant; and
hindered from evasion by her gallant cousin, who
proves to be his own unknown brother, finally marries
<i>La Fi&egrave;re</i>, and, we learn, is eventually slain with his
brother before Thebes.</p>
<p>The author of this poem calls himself Hue de
Rotelande, and says that he lives at Credehulle, which
Mr. Ward identifies with Credenhill, near Hereford.
After completing the <i>Ipomedon</i> he wrote a sequel,
<i>Prothesilaus</i>, which he dedicated to his patron, Gilbert
Fitz-Baderon, Lord of Monmouth. This Gilbert, the
only one of his family so named, was Lord of Monmouth
certainly from 1176 to 1190-91, and may have
succeeded to the dignity earlier, as the last mention of
his father is in 1165-66; but the payment by Gilbert
of a fine for trespassing in the royal forests in 1176 is
the first mention we have of him. As in the <i>Ipomedon</i>
Hue refers to the siege of Rouen in 1174, it is clear
that both his poems fall between that date and 1190,
the year of Gilbert&rsquo;s death, but we cannot date them
more exactly.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> It is, however, certain that he wrote his
poems on English ground, consequently it follows as
a matter of course that any incident of Arthurian
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
romances to which he may allude must have been
known in England at that date.</p>
<p>Now what are the indications of familiarity with
Arthurian tradition which we find in the <i>Ipomedon</i>?
Setting aside for the present the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament,
the main subject of our study, we may point out
certain other incidents which have attracted the attention
of scholars. Professor K&ouml;lbing,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> in his study of
the English versions of the poem, remarks justly that
every reader must be struck with the close resemblance
between the circumstances under which, in the second
part of the poem, Ipomedon undertakes the defence of
<i>La Fi&egrave;re</i> and the opening of the <i>Bel Inconnu</i> poems.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
It may be pointed out that while in the first instance
the parallel is with the English rather than with
the French version, <i>i.e.</i>, Ipomedon, like Libeaus
Desconus, demands the <i>first combat</i> that shall offer,
while Bel Inconnu simply asks that the first
request he shall make be granted, the feature that
the maiden leaves the court without waiting for her
unwelcome defender agrees with the French rather
than with the English version: in the latter both
depart together. As in all romances of the <i>Bel Inconnu</i>
cycle, the messenger is accompanied by a dwarf, who
endeavours to induce a more gentle treatment of the
knight, and as in all she continues to flout the hero till
confuted by his deeds of valour. In the <i>Ipomedon</i>,
certainly the conversion is more complete, as she offers
the hero her love, if he will renounce the quest and
accompany her to her own land. It is impossible to
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
read the <i>Ipomedon</i> and to doubt that the author was
familiar with the story of Gawain&rsquo;s unnamed son.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Again, the seneschal of King Meleager, Cananeus,
Caymys, or Kaenius, as his name is variously spelt, with
his sharp tongue and overbearing manner, is strongly
reminiscent of Sir Kay; and the parallel is further
brought out in the encounter with Ipomedon, where
that hero thrusts him from his steed, &lsquo;<i>tope over tayle</i>,&rsquo;
breaking in one version his shoulder-blade, in another
his arm.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> This should be compared with Lanzelet&rsquo;s
joust with Kay, and its result &lsquo;<i>er stach hern Keiin so
das im die f&uuml;eze harte h&ocirc; &ucirc;f ze berge kaften und dem
zalehaften daz houbet gein der erde fuor</i>;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> also with
<i>Morien</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> where Arthur reminds Kay of the result of
his joust with Perceval&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Hine stac u dat u wel sceen
dat gi braect u canefbeen, ende dede u oec met onneren
beide die vote opwerd keren</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor K&ouml;lbing also points out that the position
held by Cabaneus, nephew of King Meleager, is
analogous to that of Gawain, in the Arthurian cycle
(to which I would also add that the name of <i>La Fi&egrave;re</i>
recalls that of <i>L&rsquo;Orgueilleuse de Logres</i> in Chr&eacute;tien), and
decides that the romance, as a whole, &lsquo;<i>schliesst sich nach
tendenz characterzeichnung und handlung diese klasse (i.e.
dem artus-kreise) unverkennbar an</i>.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> That is, the <i>genre</i>
of composition was by 1174-90 so well established
that it was freely imitated in romances entirely unconnected
with the cycle by subject-matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>When, therefore, in direct connection with an
adventure of which several versions are preserved in
the Arthurian cycle&mdash;the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament&mdash;we
find the author of the poem excusing himself for somewhat
embroidering his tale, and quoting Walter Map
as one who practises the same art, our minds naturally
turn to the romances of that cycle, and to Map&rsquo;s
reputed connection with Arthurian story.</p>
<p>As is well known, the question as to the share which
may rightly be assigned to Walter Map in the evolution
of the Arthurian legend is one of the problems of
modern criticism. At one time or another, with the
exception of the <i>Merlin</i> and the <i>Tristan</i>, all the great
prose romances of the cycle, the <i>Lancelot</i>, in its completed
form, the <i>Grand S. Graal</i>, <i>Queste</i>, and <i>Mort
Artur</i>, have been assigned to him,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> and till quite
recently writers on early English literature did not
scruple to accept the tradition. Probably even to-day
the majority would name Walter Map as the populariser,
if not the inventor, of the Grail legend. Those,
however, who are familiar at first hand with the
romances in question have long since realised that in
their present form they represent the result of a long
period of accretion, and have undergone many redactions;
they cannot possibly, as they now stand,
be held to be the work of any one writer, certainly
not of one who took so active and leading a
part in public affairs as did Map. Further, his own
statement, in the famous words recorded by Giraldus
Cambrensis, to whom they were addressed, &lsquo;<i>Multa</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
<i>scripsistis et multum adhuc scribitis et nos multa
diximus. Vos scripta dedistis et nos verba</i>,&rsquo; with the
application that follows, have been held by Professor
Birch-Hirschfeld and other scholars to be a direct
denial on his part of any literary activity.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> At the
same time we know Map did write, and was interested
in romantic and popular tales, further that he had the
reputation of being a poet,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> and the persistence of the
tradition connecting him with the Arthurian cycle
can hardly be set aside. The question is, do these
words of Hue de Rotelande throw any light upon
this disputed point? Can we hope by the aid of
this contemporary of Map&rsquo;s to arrive at a conclusion
which may assist us in determining the real nature
of his contribution to the development of this famous
cycle, and will the ascertaining of this fact help us, as
the definite establishment of a single fact often does,
to solve other problems closely connected therewith?
Mr. Ward, when he wrote the article to which I have referred
above, expressed a decided opinion on this point;
and it appears to me that by following up the lines of
research there indicated we shall attain results far more
important in themselves, and far more startling in their
ultimate effect than he then suspected.</p>
<p>First, let us see exactly what Hue says. The
passage in question (which will not be found in the
translations) occurs at the end of the first portion of
the poem. The author has just been relating how
his hero, who is living at King Meleager&rsquo;s court, in
the assumed character of body-servant to the queen,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
scouts the idea of attending the tournament which
is to decide who shall wed <i>La Fi&egrave;re</i> of Calabria,
loudly expressing his preference for the pleasures of
the chase. Each morning he leaves the court before
daylight, announcing his departure by loud blasts of
the horn; but having reached the forest, where his
servant awaits him with steed and armour, he sends
his &lsquo;Master,&rsquo; Tholomy, to hunt in his stead; and
arming himself each day in a different suit of armour,
white, red, and black, proceeds to the tournament,
where he carries off the prize for valour, unhorsing
all the principal knights on either side, even to the
king himself, and his valiant nephew Cabaneus. Each
evening he returns to the forest, reassumes his hunter&rsquo;s
garb, and with the spoils of the chase won by Tholomy
takes his way to the court, where he vaunts the skill of
his hounds above that of the unknown knight, and is
roundly mocked for his lack of prowess by the ladies.
After the third day he leaves secretly, to return to his
own land, sending to the king, by the hand of a
messenger, the spoils of his three days&rsquo; victory. The
seneschal, Cananeus, volunteers to bring him back,
and is punished for his officious interference, as related
above.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> At the conclusion of this episode, Hue states
that he is not lying&mdash;at least not more than a little&mdash;and
if he be &lsquo;&rsquo;tis but the custom of the day, and all
the blame should not be laid upon him, Walter Map
is just as bad.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>&lsquo;Ore entendez seignurs mut ben</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Hue dit ke il ni ment de ren</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Fors aukune feiz neent mut</i></p>

<p class="t0"><i>Walter Map reset ben sa part.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;P. 82, ll. 19-30.</p>
</div>
<p>Now shall we understand this merely as a general
allusion, without any special significance, or was there
anything in the story which Hue had just been
relating which might reasonably be supposed to have
brought Map to his mind? Mr. Ward very pertinently
draws attention to the fact that this appearance at a
tournament on successive days, in different armour,
is precisely an adventure attributed to Lancelot, and
the <i>Lancelot</i> is the romance most persistently attributed
to Map. The parallel to which Mr. Ward refers
is that contained in the earlier part of the <i>Prose
Lancelot</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Lancelot first appears at Arthur&rsquo;s court in white
armour: he is known as &lsquo;le Blanc Chevalier.&rsquo; On his
first absence after receiving knighthood he is taken
prisoner by the Lady of Malehaut, who detains him
in her castle. A tournament, of a very warlike nature,
taking place between Arthur and Galehault, the lady
releases Lancelot, who, disguised in red armour, performs
deeds of surpassing valour. He returns to
prison, and on the encounter between the kings being
renewed, again appears, this time in black. Finally,
he reveals himself to the queen, and tells her that
all the feats of arms he has achieved in the characters
of white, red, and black knight were undertaken in
her honour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>The general resemblance is, as Mr. Ward remarks,
too striking to be overlooked; though, as he does <i>not</i>
remark, there are certain differences which seem to
indicate that the version of the <i>Prose Lancelot</i> has
undergone some modification. Thus, there are not
three consecutive days, but Lancelot&rsquo;s appearance
in the three characters occurs at widely separated
intervals. Further, Mr. Ward does not seem to be
aware that this is but one instance out of three in
which the same, or a similar, adventure is attributed
to Lancelot.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the <i>Prose Lancelot</i>, the section
represented by the Dutch translation, we find Arthur
holding a tournament, which has been suggested by
Guinevere with the view of recalling Lancelot, who
has long been absent, to court, and heightening his
fame. Lancelot returns secretly, unknown to all but
the queen, who sends him a message to come and
discomfit the knights who are jealous of him. Lancelot
appears in <i>red</i> armour and overthrows them all. The
queen demands another tournament in three days&rsquo;
time, when Lancelot appears as a <i>white</i> knight, with
the same result. After this he reveals himself to
Arthur.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>But the best parallel is that contained in the
<i>Lanzelet</i> of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven. Here Lanzelet
makes his first appearance at court at a three days&rsquo;
tournament; the first day dressed in <i>green</i>, the second
in <i>white</i>, the third in <i>red</i>; overthrows all opposed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
him, including Kay,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> and takes his departure, without
revealing himself.</p>
<p>With these repeated parallels before us, it seems
impossible to doubt that when Hue de Rotelande
referred to Walter Map, in connection with the tournament
episode of <i>Ipomedon</i>, he had in his mind a
version of the <i>Lancelot</i>, which also contained such a
story, and which was attributed to the latter writer.</p>
<p>But what could this version have been? Certainly
not the <i>Prose Lancelot</i> in its present form. As we
remarked before, this romance is the result of slow
growth and successive redactions, and the two parallels
contained in it bear marks of modification and dislocation.
In my recent studies on the Lancelot legend<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>
I have pointed out that in the process of evolution it
certainly passed through a stage in which it was closely
connected with, and affected by, the <i>Perceval</i> story.
Gradually the popularity of the hero of the younger
tale obscured that of the elder; and in the <i>Lancelot</i>,
as we now have it, the traces of <i>Perceval</i> influence
have almost disappeared from the majority of the
printed versions, though interesting survivals are still
to be found in certain manuscripts and in the Dutch
translation. Now one of the best known adventures
attributed to Perceval is that in which the sight of
blood-drops on new-fallen snow&mdash;caused by a bird
having been wounded, or slain, by a hawk&mdash;recalls to
his mind the lady of his love, and plunges him into
a trance; in which he is rudely attacked by Kay, who
would bring him by force to court. He retaliates by
unhorsing the seneschal with such force that he breaks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
in one version both arms, in others, an arm and a leg.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
It should also be noted that in the <i>Peredur</i> a raven
has alighted on the slain bird, and we have the three
colours, black, red, and white, recalling the lady&rsquo;s raven
hair, white skin, and crimson lips and cheeks.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Taking into consideration the proved connection
existing between the <i>Perceval</i> and the earlier forms of
the <i>Lancelot</i>, it would seem most probable that a
version of the tournament which included a similar
discomfiture of the seneschal would belong to an
earlier stage of evolution than one in which Kay
did not appear. As I have pointed out above,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> the
<i>Lanzelet</i> version not only includes Kay&rsquo;s overthrow,
but recounts it in words that forcibly recall the <i>Perceval</i>
episode.</p>
<p>It also seems probable that it was such a form which
was known to the author of the <i>Ipomedon</i>, as he makes
the discomfiture of the seneschal Cananeus, whose
resemblance to Kay has already been pointed out,
follow immediately upon the tournament episode.</p>
<p>So far, then, as the priority of existing versions is
concerned, we must, I think, give a verdict in favour
of the <i>Lanzelet</i>, though with the reservation that even
here there has been, as we shall presently see, a certain
modification of the story as known to Hue.</p>
<p>What now do we know of the source of the <i>Lanzelet</i>?
From the statement of the author,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> we learn that the
original of this poem was a French book, &lsquo;<i>daz welsche
buoch von Lanzelete</i>,&rsquo; brought to Germany by Hugo de
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Morville, one of the hostages who, in 1194, replaced
Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion in the prison of Leopold of
Austria. Thus we know that the French book must
have been prior to that date, but so far no one has
detected any reference that would enable us to fix
the period of composition more accurately. But the
character of the romance as we possess it&mdash;a collection
of episodes, many of them of marked folk-lore character,
loosely strung together, and harmonising but ill with
each other&mdash;makes it highly probable that the constituent
parts of the romance had possessed an independent
existence prior to being strung together on
the slender thread of the hero&rsquo;s personality. It is
therefore perfectly possible that the French source
of the <i>Lanzelet</i> was in existence before Hue de Rotelande
wrote the <i>Ipomedon</i>; it is more than possible,
indeed, as we shall see, a fact of almost certain
demonstration&mdash;that the adventure of the Three Days&rsquo;
Tournament had been ascribed to Lancelot, certainly
by 1160, and most probably before that date.</p>
<p>In the Didot <i>Perceval</i>, a romance which probably
formed part of a very early cyclic redaction of the
Arthurian legend, and one in which Lancelot plays
a very subordinate r&ocirc;le, we find an allusion to &lsquo;<i>le f&igrave;z
&agrave; la fille &agrave; la femme de Malehot</i>,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> which seems to
suggest that even at that comparatively early stage
the incident had undergone the modification familiar
to us in the <i>Prose Lancelot</i>. In the result, I think we
shall find that it formed one of the first steps in the
development of the <i>Lancelot</i> story.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>So far as the evidence of the <i>Ipomedon</i> goes it
suggests, if it does not absolutely prove, that at the
period when that poem was written there was current
a story which ascribed to Lancelot the adventures of
the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament, in a form which, as
might be expected in any early Lancelot version,
showed traces of the influence of the <i>Perceval</i>, and
which was popularly attributed to Walter Map. Of
the versions which we now possess, that of <i>Lanzelet</i>
best corresponds to these conditions.</p>
<h2 id="c2">CLIG&Eacute;S</h2>
<p class="bq">But there is another claimant in the field, and one
whose right to be considered the original hero of the
adventure it would, according to Professor Foerster&rsquo;s
opinion, be sheer impiety to doubt!&mdash;the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> of
Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes. In the poem of that name the
hero makes his first appearance at Arthur&rsquo;s court at
a tournament lasting for <i>four</i> successive days: he
wears successively <i>black</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>red</i>, and <i>white</i> armour;
and overthrows, on the three first days, Segramor,
Lancelot, and Perceval; fighting on the fourth day an
undecided combat with Gawain.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> Professor Foerster,
commenting on the <i>Lanzelet</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> remarks of the tournament
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
episode &lsquo;<i>das Wechseln der R&uuml;stung stammt aus
Clig&eacute;s</i>; and further on<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> affirms that Chr&eacute;tien &lsquo;<i>sich&mdash;im
Clig&eacute;s sicher als ganz selbst&auml;ndig gezeigt hat</i>,&rsquo; a statement
he repeats on p. cxxviii, and in another place<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
with even more emphasis, &lsquo;<i>Dieser selbe Kristian ist
in einem Roman wie</i> <span class="sc">Niemand</span> <i>ableugnen kann</i> <span class="sc">GANZ
SELBST&Auml;NDIG</span> <i>vorgegangen, im Clig&eacute;s</i>.&rsquo; That is, Professor
Foerster asserts, and as emphatically as print
will allow him, that Chr&eacute;tien was entirely independent
in <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>; that the episode of the change of armour is
the same in the two poems, and was borrowed by the
author of the <i>Lanzelet</i> from Chr&eacute;tien, and therefore,
if words mean anything, that Chr&eacute;tien invented the
story, and that Clig&eacute;s is the real and original hero of
the tale.</p>
<p class="bq">Well, if assertion were argument, and a liberal
display of large type could settle intricate questions
of literary criticism, we might hold the dependence
of <i>Lanzelet</i> upon <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> to be&mdash;not proven, no&mdash;but
determined. But there are some few heretics who
suspect that Professor Foerster&rsquo;s <i>ipse dixit</i>, though
imposed with all the weight of a Papal <i>imprimatur</i>,
is not really more competent to decide a problem of
sources than is that notoriously fallacious engine for
the suppression of free investigation, and therefore,
<i>more heretico</i>, we will be presumptuous enough to
examine the question for ourselves.</p>
<p class="bq">So far as the dates of the <i>existing</i> versions are concerned,
be it said at once that the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> is the older;
<i>i.e.</i> it is older than the <i>Ipomedon</i>, the <i>Lanzelet</i>, or
the <i>Prose Lancelot</i>; but how it stands with regard to
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the lost French source of the <i>Lanzelet</i> is not so easily
determined. The exact date of the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> is not
known. It was written after <i>Erec</i>, the translations from
Ovid, and the lost <i>Tristan</i>; but before the <i>Charrette</i>
and the <i>Yvain</i>, which fall between the years 1164-73.
Professor Foerster, in his Introduction to the
<i>Charrette</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> has expressed himself in favour of as late a
date as possible for that poem&mdash;towards 1170; and since
the <i>Perceval</i>, Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s last work, was written about
1182, we can scarcely place the beginning of his literary
career earlier than 1150. If we place the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> before
1160, we shall, I think, be ascribing too great an
activity to the decade 1150-60, in comparison with
1160-70. It seems more suitable to place the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>
about 1160; but, as we shall see, the argument is not
affected by a few years one way or the other.</p>
<p class="bq">The most important factor in the problem, the
French source of the <i>Lanzelet</i>, no longer exists,<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> yet it
appears certain that the whole question hinges upon
the possibility of this, or an analogous French <i>Lancelot</i>
story, having been in existence previous to the
work of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes. It therefore becomes
necessary, not only to carefully compare the two
versions, that of the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> and that of the <i>Lanzelet</i>,
but also to inquire as to the source from which the
story was originally derived. As we shall see, these
two parts of our investigation mutually supplement
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
each other, and in the sum-total present us with a
compact and striking body of evidence.</p>
<p class="bq">As a first step in the inquiry we will take the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>,
the <i>Lanzelet</i>, and the <i>Ipomedon</i> (as being anterior to
the <i>Lanzelet</i> in its present form), and see if we can
discover any traces of a knowledge of Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s work
on the part of the two later writers. The answer will be
unhesitatingly in the negative. In neither work is there
any reminiscence (with the exception of the episode in
question) either in name or incident of the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>. As a
matter of fact, allusions to this poem are exceptionally
rare. Professor Foerster states that there were two
German translations, one by Ulrich von T&uuml;rheim and
another by Konrad Fleck, but of these only fragments
remain. The <i>Parzival</i> once mentions a Cl&icirc;as, a knight
of the Round Table, and in another place refers to the
story of Alexander and Soredamors, but in each case it
is doubtful whether the allusion is to Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s poem.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
The English &lsquo;<i>Sir Cleges</i>&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> has no connection whatever
with the earlier hero, and Malory&rsquo;s allusions to a <i>Sir
Clegis</i> do not go beyond the mere name, and cannot
be identified with either. In my <i>Lancelot</i> studies I
have commented upon the indifference with which
<i>Clig&eacute;s</i> appears to have been received as being somewhat
curious considering the undoubted literary value
of the poem.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<p class="bq">On the other hand, the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> knows Lancelot as one
of Arthur&rsquo;s most valiant knights, the third in order of
merit, a position he certainly could not have held
before his story had reached a fairly advanced stage
of development. Indeed, Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s references to this
hero deserve particular attention.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> He is first mentioned
in <i>Erec</i> as a knight of the Round Table, third
in rank, the two first being Gawain and Erec, but is
only a name, taking no part in the action of the poem.
In <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> he occupies the same position, but here
Perceval, and not Erec, ranks second. Lancelot appears
upon the scene once, and once only, when he is
overthrown by <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> at the tournament in question.
In the <i>Charrette</i> he is the hero of the poem, the first
of Arthur&rsquo;s knights, the lover of the queen, and her
rescuer from the prison of Meleagant. In the <i>Chevalier
au Lion</i> which followed, his name is mentioned but
once, and that in connection with an allusion to the
<i>Charrette</i>. In the <i>Perceval</i> his name never appears at
all. It seems extraordinary that the significance of
these allusions, taken as a group, should so long have
escaped detection. As a matter of fact I failed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
grasp their importance myself when commenting upon
them in my <i>Lancelot</i> studies. Thus, the tournament
episode in <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> is so close a parallel to that of the
<i>Lanzelet</i> that, as we have seen, Professor Foerster
declares the one to be the source of the other. The
rescue of Guinevere from Meleagant, the theme of the
<i>Charrette</i>, parallels her rescue from Faler&icirc;n, also in the
<i>Lanzelet</i>. In both the queen is abducted against her
will; in both the prison is of an otherworld character:
in the one Lancelot is of the party of rescuers, but
takes no prominent share in the enterprise; in the other
he is the sole agent of her deliverance. In commenting
upon the poem in my <i>Lancelot</i> studies,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> I pointed
out that the story was, in its essence, of so primitive a
character, that it must certainly be, in its origin, of an
earlier date than any extant literary version; and that,
of the two before us, the <i>Lanzelet</i>, by its unlocalised
character, the details it gives of Faler&icirc;n&rsquo;s stronghold,
and the comparatively unimportant position assigned
to Lancelot, must be considered the older.</p>
<p class="bq">Further, in the roll of knights named in <i>Erec</i>, following
such well-known names as Gawain, Erec, Lancelot,
Gornemanz, le Biaus Coarz (Bel Couart), Le lez Hardis
(le Laid Hardi), and Melianz de Liz, we have <i>Mauduiz
li Sages</i>, who, as I have elsewhere pointed out (<i>Lancelot</i>,
p. 80), can hardly be other than the enchanter of the
<i>Lanzelet</i>, Malduz der W&icirc;se. Taking all these facts
into consideration, the position Chr&eacute;tien assigns to
Lancelot, and the two adventures (they are really only
two, the incidents of the <i>Charrette</i> are all subsidiary to
the freeing of Guinevere) he records, is it not perfectly
clear that Chr&eacute;tien knew, and followed, an early
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
version of the <i>Lancelot</i> story, akin to, if not identical
with, the lost French source of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven?
Is it not far more probable that in the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> he
borrowed from the <i>Lancelot</i> than that an adventure
so persistently, and so early, attributed to that well-known
hero should have been borrowed from the
obscure <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>?</p>
<p class="bq">If it be objected, as of course those who hold
Professor Foerster&rsquo;s views will object, that Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s
position in the literary world of the day was such that
it is infinitely more likely that he should be the lender
rather than the borrower, I would ask, but how if the
story from which he borrowed was held, rightly or
wrongly, to be the work of Walter Map? Map was
a much more important personage than Chr&eacute;tien.
Chr&eacute;tien was a poet, and a good poet, but at the best
to the world in general he would be no more than the
favoured servant and dependant of a minor French
princess. Map was a man of political importance, the
trusted companion and emissary of the most prominent
monarch of the day. What was the position held by
Map in the eyes of that same public to whom Chr&eacute;tien
appealed may be gathered by the anxiety which the
romance-writers showed to shelter themselves under
his name. We have one or two Arthurian poems,
such as <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Diu Kr&ocirc;ne</i>, which purport to be by
Chr&eacute;tien; we have a whole mass of prose romance,
practically the main body of Arthurian legend in its
later form, which professes to be the work of Walter
Map. Could testimony as to the relative status of the
two men in the eyes of their contemporaries be more
eloquent? Is it likely that Chr&eacute;tien, even if he had
held as exalted an idea of his own work as his latter-day
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
admirers would credit him with&mdash;and he did <i>not</i>&mdash;would
have thought it derogatory to his dignity to
borrow from Map? I think not; and if we had not a
jot or a tittle of further evidence on the subject, I
should contend that, on the evidence of the poems
alone, we have strong grounds for maintaining the
priority over <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> of a lost <i>Lancelot</i> version.</p>
<p class="bq">But as it happens, our case does not rest upon this
evidence alone. We have at hand an important witness;
a witness to whose evidence Professor Foerster and
his followers shut their eyes and stop their ears, but
who nevertheless is slowly, but surely, winning
recognition as an important factor in the determination
of such problems as those we are discussing. Let
us turn to folk-lore, and find if from the lips of popular
tradition we can gather evidence that may help to
decide the question. We shall find an answer startling
in its point and clearness.</p>
<h2 id="c3">THE FOLK-TALE</h2>
<p>The <i>Contes Lorrains</i> of M. Cosquin<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> contains a story,
<i>Le Petit Berger</i>, in which we shall find our tournament
adventure in what we may term full fairy-tale form.
A princess expresses a desire to own a flock of sheep;
her father consents, and hires a lad to guard them, of
whom the princess becomes secretly enamoured. On
three successive days the shepherd penetrates into a
forbidden wood, and on each occasion slays a terrible
giant, clad in steel, silver, or golden armour. By the
death of these giants the hero becomes master of three
castles, of steel, silver, and gold, in each of which he
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
finds a suit of armour and a steed to correspond. He
keeps the feat a profound secret, and when later on
the king proclaims a three days&rsquo; tournament, the prize
of which is the hand of the princess, he appears each
day in different armour, and mounted on the corresponding
steed&mdash;steel, silver or golden&mdash;wins the
tournament, and weds the lady.</p>
<p>Now this is merely the shortest and simplest form
of a story, which is found practically all the world over.
Let us look at some of the variants.</p>
<p>In the notes to <i>Le Petit Berger</i> M. Cosquin cites a
Tyrolean variant, where instead of three giants the
hero slays three dragons, thereby winning three
castles. The armour corresponds to that of the
previous tale; but the horses are black, red, and white,
herein agreeing with the <i>Ipomedon</i> and the <i>Prose
Lancelot</i>; the compiler refers to other versions from
the same country given by Zingerle,<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> but cites no
details. In an Italian variant the horses are of crystal,
silver, and gold.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to another of M. Cosquin&rsquo;s tales,
<i>Jean de l&rsquo;Ours</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> where the main theme of the story is
the release of a princess from an Otherworld prison.
Here we shall find a Greek tale given, the details of
which are, as we shall see, specially important for our
investigation. A prince delivers his sister and three
stranger princesses from the prison of a <i>drakos</i>
(translated by M. Cosquin as <i>sorte d&rsquo;ogre</i>) on the
summit of a high mountain. When about to descend
himself, his brother cuts the cord and leaves him a
prisoner on the mountain. In the ogre&rsquo;s castle he
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
sees three marvellous objects: a greyhound of velvet
pursuing a hare also of velvet; a golden ewer which
pours water of itself into a golden basin; a golden hen
with her chickens. He also finds three winged horses,
respectively white, red, and green, and sets them at
liberty. In gratitude they transport him to the plain,
and each gives him a hair from their tail, bidding him
burn it when he needs their aid. The prince takes
service with a goldsmith in his father&rsquo;s city. The
eldest brother desires to marry the eldest of the
rescued princesses; she demands a velvet greyhound
pursuing a velvet hare, such as she has seen in the
ogre&rsquo;s castle. The king offers a reward to any who
can make such an object. The pretended goldsmith&rsquo;s
apprentice undertakes to do so, and sends the green
horse to fetch the original. At the tournament in
honour of the wedding he appears on the horse in a
dress to correspond, carries off the honours of the day,
and escapes unrecognised. His second brother marries
the second princess. She demands the golden ewer&mdash;the
red horse comes to his aid, and he wins the tournament
in his red dress. When the third and youngest
princess is to be wedded to the king&rsquo;s brother he
appears in white, on the white steed, slays the would-be
bridegroom with a cast of his javelin, reveals his
identity, and wins the bride. Here we have the three
colours of the <i>Lanzelet</i>.</p>
<p>Again, in the variants of <i>Le Prince et son Cheval</i>,
another tale of the same collection,<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> we find the Three
Days&rsquo; Tournament allied to the rescue and escape
from the Otherworld <i>motif</i>. In this latter story we
have the well-known incident of escape from a giant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
or a magician, by means of magical objects which,
thrown behind the escaping pair, erect mysterious
barriers between pursuer and pursued.</p>
<p>In his notes to <i>Le Petit Berger</i>, M. Cosquin quotes
a remark of M. Mullenhoff, to the effect that in one
variant of the story collected by him it is combined
with &lsquo;<i>le conte bien connu o&ugrave; le h&eacute;ros gravit &agrave; cheval une
montagne de verre, pour conqu&eacute;rir la main d&rsquo;une belle
princesse</i>.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> Now the glass mountain is a well-recognised
form of the Otherworld prison. Probably, too, we
ought to connect with this some variants of the tale
where the feat is to attain the summit of a high tower;
a version of this is known among the Avares of the
Caucasus; here the horses are blue, red, and black.</p>
<p>Thus we may note two well-marked classes of the
tales, in one of which (<i>a</i>) the hero simply wins the
hand of the princess at a tourney; in the second of
which (<i>b</i>) he also rescues her from the Otherworld.</p>
<p>But there is a third variant of our story, in which the
feat differs somewhat from <i>b</i>. The hero is again a
rescuer, but this time he rescues the princess from
death at the jaws of a monster, generally a dragon.
This we may call class <i>c</i>. In the notes to <i>Leopold</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>
M. Cosquin refers to a German variant where the
combat lasts for three days, and horses and armour are
black, red, and white. In this connection, as member
of class <i>c</i>, Mr. Hartland has studied the story in his
well-known <i>Legend of Perseus</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> and some of the variants
he gives we shall find of interest to us.</p>
<p>In an Irish version, <i>The Thirteenth Son of the King
of Erin</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> the hero, who has previously slain three
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
giants, and taken possession of their castles and wealth,
comprising three steeds, black, brown, and red, rescues
the king&rsquo;s daughter from a great monster, a serpent of
the sea, &lsquo;which must get a king&rsquo;s daughter to devour
every seven years.&rsquo; The combat lasts three days; but
though the hero appears each day in a different dress,
only on the first does it correspond with the colour of
his horse. Here the tournament incident is lacking.</p>
<p>A very good example, this time hailing from the
Odenwald, contains the conquest of the giants
(eight), the three days&rsquo; fight with the dragon, and
the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament. Here the hero is a
king&rsquo;s son, who, seeing the portrait of the princess,
falls in love with her and dares the adventure from
which his father shrinks.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> This tale, as Mr. Hartland
points out, apparently bears traces of literary influence,
and it certainly recalls the <i>donn&eacute;es</i> of the <i>Ipomedon</i>
where the hero, also a king&rsquo;s son, is attracted by the
fame of <i>La Fi&egrave;re&rsquo;s</i> beauty, before he sees her.</p>
<p>In a gipsy variant from Transylvania, also given by
Mr. Hartland, the princess has been carried off by a
dragon to the glass mountain (thus apparently combining
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>); and the horse&mdash;there is but one&mdash;has
the mysterious property of appearing red in the
morning, white at noon, and black at night.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the legend which Mr.
Hartland was engaged in studying was, before all else, a
rescue legend&mdash;the rescue of Andromeda&mdash;consequently
the variants of our tale, collected by him, are practically
confined to what we have designated as class <i>c</i>, where
the feat performed by the hero is the rescue of the
princess from a monster. This particular feature he
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
carries back, in insular tradition, to the old Irish story
of Cuchullin&rsquo;s rescue of Deborghill from the Fomori;
sea-robbers, whose real character and origin are doubtful.
The hero hears sounds of wailing, and finds the
maiden, the daughter of the King of the Isles, exposed
upon the seashore. He confronts the Fomori, three
in number, and slays them one after the other. Thus
the triple combat is preserved, but it appears evident
that, even at this early date, the story had been
modified in the interests of romantic saga.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> With
this (class <i>c</i>) form of the story we frequently find combined
what is known as <i>The False Claimant</i> &lsquo;motif.&rsquo;
The hero disappears after the rescue, having either left
behind him some proof of his identity, such as, <i>e.g.</i>, the
binding of the heads of the monster on a withy in such
a manner that none but himself can unloose them; or
having in his possession such a proof as, <i>e.g.</i> the
tongues of the severed heads, or the handkerchief, ring,
or ear-ring of the princess. By means of this proof he
confutes the cowardly rival who claims to have achieved
the feat. This particular form of the story is perhaps,
on the whole, the one in which it is best known. There
is one group which, as we shall see, is of extraordinary
interest and importance for the special study in which
we are engaged.</p>
<p>In his <i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>, under
the title of the <i>Sea Maiden</i>, Mr. Campbell gives the
following story.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> An old and childless fisherman
meets with persistent ill-luck in his calling, till one day
a sea-maiden rises from the waves and promises him
future success, if he in return will give her his firstborn
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
son (assuring him of the birth of three). The fisher
consents, and all falls out as the maiden foretells.
Grown to manhood, the son, aware of the fate in store
for him, resolves to go &lsquo;where there is not a drop of
sea-water.&rsquo; He sets out, and on his journey finds a
lion, a wolf, and a falcon disputing over the carcase of
a horse. He divides the spoil between them, and in
return they promise him their aid, should he be in need
of it. He becomes herdsman to a king, and we have
the adventure with the three giants, in which the grateful
beasts aid him, and he wins a white, a red, and a green
filly &lsquo;that will go through the skies&rsquo;&mdash;obviously the
winged horses of the Greek folk-tale<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a>&mdash;and three dresses
to correspond. Here he also slays the giants&rsquo; mother,
and wins a comb and a basin, the use of which will
make him the most beautiful man on earth. Follows
the adventure with the sea-monster, a dragon apparently.
The fight lasts for three days, and he appears each day
in a different dress, and mounted on a different steed.
The princess makes a mark on his forehead as he
sleeps, and thus identifies the hero as her rescuer.
They marry, but while walking by the seashore, the
sea-maiden rises from the waves and carries off the
hero as her property. The princess, by the advice of
a soothsayer, succeeds in releasing her husband, and
with the help of the grateful beasts, destroys the soul
of the sea-maiden, which is in an egg. She being slain,
the pair live happily ever after.</p>
<p>In this particular variant there is no <i>False Claimant</i>;
but he appears in version number three of this story, and
in version four we have the curious detail that the beast
&lsquo;was a fresh-water lake when he had killed her.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Students of folk-lore will note that the tale in this
form includes features not found in the majority of
the versions, but representing well-recognised folk-tale
<i>formul&aelig;</i>. Thus the <i>Life Token</i> is here&mdash;incomplete&mdash;the
maiden gives the fisherman &lsquo;something&rsquo; to be
given to his wife, his horse, and his dog (obviously
a <i>fisherman</i> does not need a horse and a dog&mdash;these two
features do not belong to each other); the wife has
three sons, the horse three foals, and the dog three
pups. Horse and dog ought rightly to play a part in
the story, but in this special variant they do not
appear, though in another they are mentioned in a
subordinate r&ocirc;le. The <i>Grateful Beasts</i> and the
<i>External Soul</i> are equally well known in folk-tale,
though again, as a rule, in a different connection. But
the tournament is lacking; and after examining
many variants of the tale, I have come to the conclusion
that this feature belongs exclusively to the
continental versions. Horses and dresses are found in
the insular forms, but, so far, I have not found a single
instance of the tournament. On the other hand, no
continental variant appears to contain the sea-maiden
episodes.</p>
<p>If we now summarise the leading incidents of the
various groups, we shall find them somewhat as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Hero&mdash;King&rsquo;s son. Herdsman or shepherd.
Fisherman&rsquo;s son turned herdsman.</p>
<p>2. Slays three giants and wins three castles in which
he finds three steeds of different colours with
dresses or armour to correspond. The horses
are occasionally winged.</p>
<p>3. Appears at a Three Days&rsquo; Tournament in
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
these dresses, and thus wins the hand of a
princess.</p>
<p>(Incidents 1, 2, 3, which combined correspond
to <i>Le Petit Berger</i>, form the shortest
version of our story, but probably not the most
primitive.)</p>
<p>4. Rescues the princess from an &lsquo;Otherworld&rsquo;
prison. Form of imprisonment varies, but the
&lsquo;rescue&rsquo; is most generally found in company with
the tournament.</p>
<p>5. Rescues princess from a monster. Here the
conflict generally lasts three days, the three
disguises are employed, and the tournament is
often absent.</p>
<p>6. Is robbed of the credit of his deed by a cowardly
rival. This, which is most generally found in
combination with 5, is also sometimes found in
a modified form combined with 4, and is often
lacking altogether.</p>
<p>7. Is carried off by a mermaid, to whom he had been
promised before his birth. This appears to be
confined to the Celtic group collected by Mr.
Campbell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the reader will refer to the various examples I
have given above, he will see that these seven incidents
represent what we may call the perfect skeleton of our
story (to use a simile often applied by Mr. Campbell),
though the bones are differently placed in different
versions.</p>
<p>But, having summarised them, we also become aware
of a very curious coincidence. Out of these seven
incidents, six are found, and found more than once, in
the earlier forms of the <i>Lancelot</i> story. Thus dropping
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
out incident 2, the winning of the armour, to which I
know no good parallel, we find that Lancelot was a
king&rsquo;s son (incident 1), which, in itself, of course counts
for little, but is of value in combination with other
features (<i>Lanzelet</i>&mdash;<i>Prose Lancelot</i>); that he appears
at a tournament, three days running, in different
armour, the colours of which correspond with the prevailing
colours of the folk-tale&mdash;green, red, white, or
black, red, white (incident 3) (<i>Lanzelet</i>&mdash;<i>Prose Lancelot</i>);
that he frees a princess (queen) from an Otherworld
prison (incident 4) (<i>Charrette</i>&mdash;<i>Prose Lancelot</i>&mdash;<i>Lanzelet</i>,
modified form); that he slays a monster (apparently a
dragon), and is robbed by a cowardly rival (incidents
5 and 6) (<i>Morien</i>). A second version of the <i>False
Claimant</i> story is found in <i>Le cerf au pied blanc</i>.
Finally, when a child, he was carried off by a water
maiden, <i>meer-w&icirc;b</i> (incident 7) (<i>Lanzelet</i>&mdash;<i>Prose Lancelot</i>).</p>
<p>Now these are characteristics which, in their <i>ensemble</i>,
he shares with no other Arthurian hero. True, Gawain
visits the Otherworld, but he does so rather in the
character of lover of the queen of that world than as
rescuer of one confined within its precincts. In the
Dutch <i>Walewein</i> alone, so far as I know, is his r&ocirc;le
definitely that of the deliverer. But none of the other
incidents belong to his story. So, too, Tristan is the
hero of a very fine version of the <i>Dragon Slayer</i> and
<i>False Claimant</i> story, and it is moreover probable that
the <i>Morien</i> version has borrowed certain details from
the <i>Tristan</i>, but he too can claim no share in the other
incidents. The close correspondence, point by point,
with a folk-tale of so widespread and representative
a character, is, I submit, a peculiarity of the earlier
<i>Lancelot</i> story, which is of extraordinary interest as
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
throwing light upon the genesis and growth of
Arthurian legend.</p>
<p>In this connection I have by no means forgotten
the energetic protests which, in certain quarters, were
evoked by Mr. Nutt&rsquo;s attempt to show that the story
of <i>Perceval</i> might in this way be connected with
popular tales; and I am quite prepared to be told that
tales collected in the nineteenth century are not to be
trusted as indications of the sources of twelfth century
romance. But in the instance before us the evidence,
while of precisely the same nature as in the case of
<i>Perceval</i>, exceeds it, both in bulk and extent. The
story is not one story, but a large and well-marked
group of tales; the folk-lore parallels affect not one,
but many incidents of the romance. How large and
how widely diffused is that story-group can only be
appreciated by those who will examine the lists of
variants appended by M. Cosquin to the four stories
I have named above and those cited by Mr. Campbell
under the heading of the <i>Sea Maiden</i>, and then compare
these stories with the numerous examples given
by Mr. Hartland in his exhaustive study of the <i>Perseus</i>
legend. The incidents are, as I have shown, six out
of a possible list of seven. If, further, we remember
that the group, with all its varying forms, is connected
with such pre-historic heroes as Perseus and Cuchullin,
we have, I think, a sufficient answer to those critics
who would reject the evidence <i>en masse</i> on the ground
of modernity.</p>
<p>But supposing, for the sake of argument, that we
accept the possible priority of the romantic over the
popular form, what, with regard to the criticism of the
Arthurian literary cycle, is the logical result? This:
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
if the folk-tale be dependent upon a romance, that
romance must of necessity be the <i>Lancelot</i>, as no other
hero offers the same combination of incident. But a
version of the <i>Lancelot</i> story, from which <i>all</i> these
incidents could have been borrowed, must have been
older than any form of the story we now possess. As
we have seen above, the correspondence is sometimes
with one, sometimes with another version; and a very
famous incident of the tale, the <i>False Claimant</i>, only
exists now in two romances, each of them preserved in
an isolated and unique form. Therefore, if this be not
a fully proven instance of the conversion of a popular
folk-tale into an Arthurian romance, it must be a case
of the development of a folk-tale from a fully organised
and coherent <i>Lancelot</i> story in a form anterior to
Chr&eacute;tien. The adherents of the theory which ascribes
independent invention to Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, and a
literary origin to the Arthurian stories, can make their
choice between these two solutions of the problem&mdash;one
or the other it must be.</p>
<p>For myself, I unreservedly accept the verdict pronounced
by Mr. Campbell upon the <i>Sea Maiden</i> as
representative of the entire story-group. &lsquo;Is it possible
that a Minglay peasant and Straparola<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> (<i>or we may
add Hue de Rotelande and the peasants of the Odenwald
and Lorraine</i>)&mdash;neither of whom can have seen a
giant, or a flying horse, or a dragon, or a mermaid&mdash;could
separately imagine all these impossible things,
and, having imagined them simultaneously, invent the
incidents of the story and arrange so many of them in
the same order?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&lsquo;Is it on the other hand possible that all these barefooted,
bareheaded, simple men, who cannot read,
should yet learn the contents of one class of rare
books and of no other? I cannot think so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have gone through the whole <i>Sea Maiden</i> story,
and all its Gaelic versions, and marked and numbered
each separate incident, and divided the whole into its
parts, and then set the result beside the fruit of a
similar dissection of Straparola&rsquo;s <i>Fortunio</i>, and I find
nearly the whole of the bones of the Italian story, and
a great many bones which seem to belong to some
original antediluvian Aryan tale. The Scotch (<i>insular</i>)
is far wilder and more mythical than the Italian
(<i>continental</i>).<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> The one savours of tournaments, kings&rsquo;
palaces, and the manners of Italy long ago; the other
of flocks and herds, fishermen and pastoral life; but
the Highland imaginary beings are further from reality
and nearer to creatures of the brain. The horses of
Straparola are very material and walk the earth; those
of old John MacPhie are closely related to Pegasus
and the horses of the Veda, and fly and soar through
grimy peat-reek to the clouds.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Campbell continues: &lsquo;What is true of the
Gaelic and Italian versions is equally true of all
others which I know. If examined, they will be
found to consist of a bare tree of branching incidents
common to all, and so elaborate that no minds could
possibly have invented the whole seven or eight times
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
over<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> without some common model, and yet no one
of these is the model, for the tree is defective in all, and
its foliage has something peculiar to each country in
which it grows. They are specimens of the same
plant, but their common stock is nowhere to be
found.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> Were Mr. Campbell living now, may we not
feel sure that to these closing words he would add:
<i>Assuredly it is not to be sought in an Arthurian
romance of the twelfth century</i>?</p>
<h2 id="c4">THE ROMANCE</h2>
<p>So much for the present as regards our folk-tale as
a whole. Let us now see what light the study of it
may have thrown upon the special subject of our
investigation&mdash;the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament. And
first of all, I think it has definitely settled the correctness
of our title. East or west, north or south,
wherever we have traced our story, whatever the
hero&rsquo;s feat&mdash;whether the rescuing the princess from
a devouring dragon, or the winning her hand at a
knightly tournament&mdash;the days required to complete
the task are <i>three</i>&mdash;neither more nor less.</p>
<p>Mr. Hartland, to whom I referred the point, remarks
that the unvarying tendency in certain families of
folk-tales, notably those of Oriental origin, is to
crystallise a small but indefinite number into <i>three</i>.
Now Mr. Campbell, as we have seen, detects a likeness
between the flying horses of the <i>Sea Maiden</i> tales,
and the horses of the Veda, and Mr. Joseph Jacobs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
in a note appended to another tale,<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> quotes a further
remark of the same writer, to the effect that the many-coloured
horses of Indian mythology may account for
all the magical horses of folk-tales. So if our tale, as
a whole, did not come from the east, it seems possible
that this particular incident may have done so.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
<p>Yet in so far as the tournament form is concerned,
it is, of course, <i>possible</i> that certain literary versions of
the story might have been affected by the ordinary
customs of the day. Anyway there seems to be a
fairly close correspondence here between fact and
fancy. Niedner, in his work on <i>Das Deutsche Turnier</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a>
remarks that the tourney proper was generally held
on a Monday; the knights assembled on the previous
Saturday; Sunday morning was spent in mustering
those present and arranging the opposing factions;
while the afternoon was devoted to the encounter
known as the <i>Vesper-spiel</i>, preliminary to the grand
struggle of the morrow. Thus the ordinary duration
of such a meeting might be reckoned as three days.</p>
<p>But it is clear that there might also be three
distinct encounters on as many separate days, as in
the folk-tale. Professor Kittredge, in his article, &lsquo;Who
was Sir Thomas Malory?<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a>&rsquo; notes a very remarkable
and pertinent instance taken from the life of Richard
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. When that nobleman
was Governor of Calais, hearing of a great gathering
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of knights, to be held in the neighbourhood, &lsquo;he cast
in his mynde to do sume newe poynt of chevalry&rsquo;; and
under the several names of <i>The Grene Knight</i>, <i>Chevalier
Vert</i>, and <i>Chevalier Attendant</i>, sent three challenges to
the French king&rsquo;s court. These being accepted, he
appeared the first two days in differing armour, the
third &lsquo;in face opyn,&rsquo; on each occasion overthrowing his
antagonist.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> The days in question are given by Rous
as January 6th, 7th, and 8th; the year he does not
mention; but Professor Kittredge, by a process of
elimination, arrives at the conclusion that it must have
been either 1416 or 1417. It is, of course, obvious
that this feat must have been suggested by the
romances. It is, I think, equally obvious that the
three days of the romances were not at variance with
actual practice. As to the version of the folk-tale
there can be no question. The correct number is three&mdash;neither
more nor less.</p>
<p>It is, of course, also clear that the occurrence of the
tournament in the folk-tale must be subsequent to the
institution of tournaments as part of the ordinary
chivalric and social conditions; but the tale itself
must be earlier, as is witnessed both by the archaic
nature of the rescue incident and the magical nature
of the horses. Trials of skill in horsemanship are
known to all stages of society; and the original form
of this special incident was doubtless something of this
kind. In the Odenwald variant referred to above,
the hero has to perform the feat of carrying off on
his spear a ring suspended from a beam, and to hang
it up again in returning. This is here supposed to
form part of the tournament; but it seems most likely
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
that in earlier forms the trial of skill by which the
hero was tested and identified was simply some such
feat of skilled horsemanship.</p>
<p>Nor do I think that we are to see the influence of
romance, rather than of custom, in this transformation.
Neither of the poems in which the incident approximates
most closely to the folk-tale form, the <i>Lanzelet</i>
and the <i>Ipomedon</i>, appear to have been particularly
popular (certainly not the former), judging from the
number of manuscripts in which they have been preserved,
while the &lsquo;Tournament&rsquo; form of the folk-tale is
found all over Europe. It is much more reasonable,
surely, to conclude that the episode has been borrowed,
as so many others have been borrowed, from the stores
of popular tradition than to hold that in this case
popular tradition has been modified by the influences
of a literary cycle.</p>
<p>But is it not as clear as daylight that all this
immense body of evidence absolutely and finally
disposes of any claim on the part of Chr&eacute;tien to be
first in the field? The <i>four</i> days of <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> rule that
romance, as a source, out of court at once and for
ever. Further, not only is that version demonstrably
secondary in itself, but definitely secondary to and
dependent upon the <i>Lancelot</i> versions. These correspond
with the prevailing colours of the folk-tale&mdash;black,
red, and white, or green, red, and white.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> The
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
one is the version of the <i>Prose Lancelot</i>, the other of
the <i>Lanzelet</i>. Chr&eacute;tien not only gives one day too
many, but manifestly does so in order to combine the
two versions which he, in common with us, knew, and
gives <i>both</i> green and black&mdash;two colours which are
found together in no single version of all the dozens
I have read.</p>
<p>There is a possible &lsquo;clerical&rsquo; explanation of the
existence of two versions of the <i>Lancelot</i> tale. <i>Noir</i> in
the manuscript may have been read <i>vair</i>, and a copyist
writing from oral dictation may thus have substituted
<i>vert</i>. But in the face of the green, red, and white of the
very primitive Celtic variant given by Mr. Campbell,
and confirmed by the Greek parallel, I think it more
likely that the three colours of the <i>Lanzelet</i> represent
the older form. But inasmuch as in romances, which,
like the Arthurian, were supposed to correspond in
some measure to the conditions of real life, a green
<i>horse</i> would be an impossibility, while yet horse and
armour should correspond, black&mdash;perhaps under the
influence of the <i>Perceval</i> story&mdash;would take its place.
Both were represented in the folk-tale, and it may be
that the version of the <i>Prose Lancelot</i> and of the
<i>Ipomedon</i> simply represents &lsquo;the survival of the fittest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That there were <i>two</i> versions a closer study will,
I think, make evident. Probably those who have
followed the argument and illustrations closely will
have already detected what hitherto I have left unnoted,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
that the version of the <i>Ipomedon</i> stands in a
much closer relation with certain forms of the folk-tale,
<i>i.e.</i> the <i>Petit Berger</i> or <i>a</i> group, than is the case
with either the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> or the two <i>Lancelot</i> versions.
In the <i>Ipomedon</i> alone the prize of the Three Days&rsquo;
Tournament is the hand of the princess. And not
only is there agreement in this, the leading, feature,
but there is also a curious correspondence in minor
details. Thus, both in the poem and in the folk-tale,
the hero, in the character of a servant, has already
won the princess&rsquo;s love. In both she is bitterly disappointed
at his apparent failure to compete. In the
folk-tale she sends each evening to ask why the
shepherd-lad has taken no part in the tourney, receiving
each time the answer that he was unwell, but
would do his best to appear on the morrow. In the
poem, each evening Ipomedon sends word to the
princess that it is he who has gained the tourney, but
that he is leaving the country immediately, and will
not be present on the next day. Thus the heroine, in
each case, is kept in uncertainty as to the intentions
of her lover.</p>
<p>If we add to this the correspondence with the
Odenwald variant already pointed out,<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> and the fact
that in the <i>Ipomedon</i> alone the hero is wounded on
the third day&mdash;a feature found not only in the
Odenwald story but in several variants of <i>Le Prince
et son Cheval</i>&mdash;it becomes clear that if there be a
doubt as to the source of the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> or the <i>Lanzelet</i>,
the <i>Ipomedon</i> version must repose, directly or indirectly,
upon the folk-tale.</p>
<p>But, as we have seen, it is precisely the evidence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the <i>Ipomedon</i> which leads us to connect the story with
Walter Map, and the romance ascribed to him, the
<i>Lancelot</i>. What, then, are we to conclude? I think
the only satisfactory interpretation is that which I
have suggested above, that there were two versions
of the story; in one of which the hero was represented
as winning, and probably wedding, the princess; in
the other the incident, whatever its original form, had
already been so far modified as simply to provide an
effective setting for his first appearance at Arthur&rsquo;s
court. This is indeed what we find in the <i>Lanzelet</i>;
and the general tone of that poem, wherein the hero
wins the hand of no fewer than four ladies, and
certainly weds three of them, shows that there would
be no initial improbability in postulating another and
more primitive form of the story.</p>
<p>To return to <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>. The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of the
tournament episode should be considered. The hero
of the adventure does not compete with any number
of knights, but is each day confronted with a chosen
champion. These are, as I have already shown,
Segramor, Lancelot, Perceval, and Gawain; and so
far as the first three are concerned they appear here,
and here only, their names, even, being otherwise
unmentioned throughout the six thousand seven
hundred and eighty lines of the poem.</p>
<p>To any one thoroughly familiar with the Arthurian
romances, the juxtaposition of these three names is
extremely significant. The adventure itself is elsewhere
assigned to Lancelot. The hero with whom
the <i>Lancelot</i> story in its earlier stages is most closely
associated is Perceval; Chr&eacute;tien himself here introduces
Perceval as a famous knight, with whose renown
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Clig&eacute;s was already familiar, and ranks him above
Lancelot. One of the best-known adventures ascribed
to Perceval is, as we have already shown, one in which
the three colours, black, red, and white, figure, and in
which he overthrows Kay in a manner curiously akin
to other versions of the tournament episode. But
previous to overthrowing Kay he had vanquished
Segramor, who was the first to attack him. Is it not
evident that Chr&eacute;tien, like the authors of the <i>Ipomedon</i>
and the original <i>Lanzelet</i>, was here reminded of the
blood-drops adventure? If it be asked why introduce
Segramor instead of Kay, we may recall the fact that
while Clig&eacute;s is represented as nephew to the Emperor
of Constantinople, Segramor, as the <i>Merlin</i> tells us, was
son to that potentate. Chr&eacute;tien <i>may</i> have introduced
him as less known in connection with this than Kay,
who is never once named in <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>; but I think it more
likely that it was his parallelism to the hero, as well as
his connection with Perceval, which determined his
appearance.</p>
<p>But with regard to the latter, there is another point
which deserves mention. In that section of the <i>Peredur</i>
which does not correspond to any section of the <i>Conte
del Graal</i> we find the hero, released from prison by the
daughter of his jailer, attending a warlike tournament,
in which each day he carries off the prizes; but there
is no change of armour, and the days appear to be
four instead of three. Previously to this he has also
appeared three successive days at a tournament; but
overcome by the beauty of the empress, of whom he
is enamoured, he remains gazing at her, instead of
taking part in the contest, until the third and final day.
These passages are deserving of note, as they appear
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
to me to show direct contact between the <i>Perceval</i>
and <i>Lancelot</i> stories, and in this instance the borrowing
appears to be on the part of the earlier story.
Not only is Lancelot released from the prison of
the Lady of Malehault to attend a tournament, thus
corresponding with the one instance, but when he
arrives on the spot he behaves in precisely the same
manner at the sight of Guinevere as is recorded of
Peredur with the empress. I do not feel able to
accept the tournament as a real part of the <i>Perceval</i>
story, no other feature of any version of the Perceval
&lsquo;<i>Enfances</i>&rsquo; corresponding with the <i>formul&aelig;</i> of the
group in question; yet the correspondence of detail
between the two stories is so undeniable that contact
of some sort, direct or indirect, there must be, and I
think in this case we must hold that the <i>Peredur</i> has
been influenced by a version of the <i>Lancelot</i> akin to
that preserved in the prose redaction.</p>
<p>To return to <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>. Taking into consideration all
the evidence, the importance and widespread character
of the folk-tale, the closer correspondence of both the
<i>Ipomedon</i> and the <i>Lanzelet</i> to the popular form, and
the peculiarities of the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> version, it becomes, I
think, impossible to doubt that this latter, so far from
being the <i>source</i> of the <i>Lanzelet</i>, is, as submitted above,
not merely posterior to, but distinctly dependent upon
a form of that story. And if we admit this, must we
not also admit that here, at least, Chr&eacute;tien did <i>not</i>
understand the character of the material with which
he was dealing, and that in this instance he certainly
deserves the epithet which Professor Foerster asserts we
would wish to apply to him, that of <i>ein verschlechternder
Ueberarbeiter</i>? The phrase, be it remembered, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Professor Foerster&rsquo;s, and not mine; but so admirably
does it suit the present question, that I can only
say, &lsquo;<i>I thank thee, friend, for teaching me this word!</i>&rsquo;
Chr&eacute;tien was <i>not</i> dealing directly with popular tradition,
but taking it at second-hand after it had already
been modified and worked over in romantic form. To
put it tersely, in the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament we have
a folk-tale theme intelligently adapted by the authors
of the <i>Ipomedon</i> and the <i>Lanzelet</i>, and misunderstood
and &lsquo;muddled&rsquo; by Chr&eacute;tien.</p>
<h2 id="c5">THE BEARING ON THE LANCELOT STORY</h2>
<p>But the interesting problems connected with this
episode are not all solved when we have determined
the ultimate source of the story, and the position to
be assigned to Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s version. As we have seen,
there is strong ground for believing that the French
poet knew two versions of the <i>Lancelot</i> story; is it not
possible that one of these versions may have been the
lost French source of the <i>Lanzelet</i>? The &lsquo;setting&rsquo; of
the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> tournament, in which the hero makes his
first appearance at Arthur&rsquo;s court, corresponds with
that of the <i>Lanzelet</i>; and, as we have remarked above,
in the <i>Erec</i> we find not only the name of Lancelot, but
also that of the enchanter Mauduiz, who appears nowhere
save in U. von Zatzikhoven&rsquo;s poem. Professor
Foerster&rsquo;s opinion is that we must consider the
German <i>Lanzelet</i> as &lsquo;<i>die m&ouml;glichst getreue Wiedergabe
eines franz&ouml;sischen Originals</i>&rsquo;; and on this point
at least, I, for one, am quite prepared to agree with
him. Whether, after a real study of that poem (with
which I strongly suspect he had only a superficial
familiarity), the learned professor will desire to maintain
his opinion is another question! But, granting
that the German version correctly reproduces the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
French original, the nature of the work&mdash;a loosely
connected collection of independent tales, of marked
folk-lore character&mdash;points to a period of evolution
anterior to Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s well-knit and elaborately
polished literary productions.</p>
<p>Then, again, there arises the question, Granting the
existence of a <i>Lancelot</i> romance previous to Chr&eacute;tien,
could Walter Map have been the author? On this
point it is not easy, with the material at our disposal,
to express a decided opinion. Map and Chr&eacute;tien
were certainly contemporaries, but in neither case do
we know the date of birth. Map died in 1209, therefore
we may suppose he was not born long before
1140; a later date is scarcely probable, as he was a
student at Paris in 1154, and at the court of Henry <span class="small">II</span>.
before 1162.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> We do not know when Chr&eacute;tien wrote
the <i>Erec</i>, but it was almost certainly some time in the
decade 1150-60. That Map should have been the
author of a <i>Lancelot</i> poem earlier than the <i>Erec</i> is
quite possible, but, perhaps, not very probable; but
there would have been ample time for him to write
one before the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>. Thus, while I think it highly
probable that Chr&eacute;tien borrowed from Map in the
latter poem, I would reserve my opinion as to the
former. Of the probable character of such a work we
can gather some idea from Map&rsquo;s undoubted literary
remains; <i>De Nugis Curialium</i> offers abundant proof of
the writer&rsquo;s taste for popular tales and traditions. Had
he lived in the nineteenth-twentieth centuries, instead
of the twelfth-thirteenth, Map would undoubtedly
have been a prominent member of the Folk-Lore
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Society.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> His <i>Lancelot</i> poem might have been a
short episodic romance of folk-tale character, a Three
Days&rsquo; Tournament story, or it might have been a
collection of such episodes, like the <i>Lanzelet</i>, <i>i.e.</i> its
character would probably be <i>popular</i> rather than
<i>literary</i>. I should myself have felt inclined to decide
for the <i>Lanzelet</i> source, were it not for the evidence
of the <i>Ipomedon</i>, which appears to presuppose a version
closer to the original folk-tale.</p>
<p>Another point to be borne in mind in connection
with the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i>, and one to which I have already
drawn attention,<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> is the peculiar geography of the
poem, which is distinctly Anglo-Norman rather than
Arthurian; the tale is obviously composed of originally
independent themes; and whatever may have been
contained in the book of the Beauvais Library, I think
it is at the least possible that part of Chretien&rsquo;s
material came to him from insular sources.</p>
<p>As regards the <i>Lanzelet</i>, we know that the source of
that poem came from England, and elsewhere<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> I have
pointed out that a curious allusion to England (<i>not</i> as
is more usual to <i>Britain</i>) seems to make it probable
that the French original was written in this island.
If we couple with this the authorship and evidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of the <i>Ipomedon</i>, and the persistent attribution of a
<i>Lancelot</i> romance to Walter Map, we have, I think, a
strong presumption in favour of an early <i>insular</i> version
of that story.</p>
<p>While this study was in the printer&rsquo;s hands I came
across the following allusion to the slaying of a dragon
by Lancelot; it occurs in the Auchinleck Manuscript
version of <i>Sir Bevis of Hampton</i> (<b><i>Cxxx</i></b>):&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;<i>After Josianis cristing</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Beves dede a gret fighting&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Swich bataile ded never non</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Cristene man of flesch and bon&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Of a dragoun thar beside,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>That Beves slough ther in that tide;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Save Sire Lancelet de Lake</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>He faught with a furdrake</i> [fiery dragon],</p>
<p class="t0"><i>And Wade dede also</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And never knightes boute thai to.</i>&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This allusion is the more interesting as, saving in
the case of <i>Morien</i>, to which I have already referred,
I have nowhere found this special feat attributed to
Lancelot; certainly it does not occur in the whole
extent of the <i>Prose Lancelot</i>, nor is it ever alluded to
in that romance. Yet, if my theory of the evolution of
the Lancelot legend be correct, such a combat ought
certainly, at one time, to have formed part of his
story. The evidence of this Anglo-Norman romance,
supported as it is by the independent testimony of
<i>Morien</i>, is therefore especially welcome; I am inclined
to think that it strongly increases the probability
of a definitely <i>insular</i> version of the story,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
differing in some respects from the <i>continental</i>, having
existed at the time the &lsquo;<i>Sir Bevis</i>&rsquo; was written.</p>
<p>Nor would the existence of such a version be, as
Professor Foerster asserts, incompatible with the continental
<i>origin</i> of the character;<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> to assert as much is
really to stultify his own arguments. Does not the
whole system of Professor Foerster rest upon the
hypothesis that the character of Arthur, indisputably
of insular <i>origin</i>, underwent development upon continental
ground? The fact that what he roundly
denies of Arthur he asserts emphatically as natural
for Lancelot throws a flood of light upon the <i>ex parte</i>
character of this distinguished scholar&rsquo;s methods!</p>
<p>If we take into consideration the character of the
elements composing the early <i>Lancelot</i> story, a
character which, be it remembered, is not a question
of suggestion but a matter of proof, we shall become
clearly aware that the material for development
existed on both sides of the Channel. I believe
myself that Lancelot was of continental origin, but I
recognise clearly that if the source and development
of his story were such as I suppose them to have been,
that continental origin was a matter of accident, not
of necessity; and if some other scholar should bring
forward arguments to prove that the story had its rise
on insular rather than on continental ground, I shall
be quite prepared to reconsider the question.</p>
<p>So far as the evidence I have now collected is
concerned, it looks as if the development of the early
<i>Lancelot</i> story might thus be sketched:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>a.</i>  <i>Lai</i> (presumably Breton), relating theft of king&rsquo;s
son by water-fairy, amplified by</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p><i>b.</i> Bringing up of youth in Otherworld kingdom,
peopled by women only (source, general Celtic
tradition, possibly <i>Gawain</i> legend).</p>
<p><i>c.</i> His entry into the world (<i>Perceval</i> legend).</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Introduction of adventures of <i>Sea Maiden</i> story,
<i>a</i> being the point of contact, and suggesting the
development, which may have been as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>d<sup>a</sup>.</i> Winning of magic steeds and armour.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>d<sup>b</sup>.</i> { Rescue of princess from monster, and <i>False Claimant</i> story; or</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>d<sup>c</sup>.</i> { Rescue of princess from Otherworld. As we have seen (p. 25), it would be quite possible for these to be combined.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>d<sup>d</sup>.</i> Appearance at Three Days&rsquo; Tournament.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It would seem not improbable that it was the independent
existence of incident <i>d<sup>c</sup></i> in the popular tale
that led to its coalescing with the Arthurian legend.
As I have elsewhere pointed out,<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> the character of the
Guinevere abduction story is in itself so primitive that
it may well have formed part of the earliest stratum of
Arthurian tradition. The variants are of such a
nature as to indicate that they arose at a period when
the real meaning of the story was still understood,
and carefully retained. The tale must therefore be far
older than any extant <i>literary</i> version.</p>
<p>If we admit the suggested hypothesis&mdash;that the hero
of the Lancelot <i>lai</i> became through the &lsquo;mermaid&rsquo;
incident identified with the hero of the <i>Sea Maiden</i>
story&mdash;the character of that story, and the immense
popularity to which its wide diffusion testifies, would
give us a solid working hypothesis to account for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
choice of Lancelot as Guinevere&rsquo;s lover. The similarity
of the stories led to his identification with her rescuer,
and that step once taken the recognition of him as
her lover was&mdash;given the social conditions of the time
and the popularity of the <i>Tristan</i> story&mdash;a foregone
conclusion.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a></p>
<p>But this evolution, so far as we can tell, took place
on <i>both</i> sides of the Channel. Thus, while I have found
no single <i>insular</i> version which gives the Tournament
episode, I have equally found no <i>continental</i> variant
which contains the mermaid. Yet it is the latter
(mermaid) which appears to form the point of contact
between the folk-tale and the <i>lai</i>, while it is the persistent
recurrence of the former (the Tournament)
which has given us the key to disentangle the complicated
evolution of the story.</p>
<p>Here is a point on which I should wish to make my
position perfectly clear. I do not think that Lancelot
was <i>ab origine</i> the hero of a variant of this popular and
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
widely-spread folk-tale. The persistent element in
the <i>Lancelot</i> story is, as I have elsewhere shown, his
connection with the beneficent Lady of the Lake.
Now the maiden of the folk-tale is a sea, not a lake,
maiden, and is, further, consistently represented as of
a malicious, rather than a kindly, character. True,
she aids the fisher in the first instance, but she belongs
to that order of beings whose gifts, apparently
desirable, are saddled with conditions which turn to
the undoing, rather than to the profit of the receiver.
Also, her presence in the story is restricted to a small
and well-marked group of variants, which apparently
preserve a primitive type of the story, and are never
combined with the Tournament, which recurs so frequently
in the <i>Lancelot</i> romances.</p>
<p>Again this folk-tale, <i>qu&acirc;</i> folk-tale, does not belong
to the same group as that which offers parallels to the
<i>Perceval</i> story; yet the <i>Lancelot</i> story was certainly
affected, and that at an early stage of development,
by the <i>Perceval</i>. Folk-lore students are well aware
of the facility with which one story-type can
become contaminated by another originally distinct
from it; and while I see in the common &lsquo;folk-tale&rsquo;
origin of the two legends a satisfactory explanation of
the undeniable influence traceable through all the
earlier stages of the <i>Lancelot</i> evolution, I would yet
distinguish sharply between the two heroes. Perceval
is a British (insular) Celt; Lancelot a continental
(Breton) Celt, the development of whose story is
posterior to that of the insular hero. For all these
reasons I think it most probable that Lancelot was the
hero of an independent, and originally short, tale,
which by an accidental similarity of incident became
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
connected with one of the most popular of known folk-tales,
from which it freely borrowed adventures, and
which, through the medium of one of these adventures,
became later incorporated with the Arthurian tradition
and developed upon romantic lines.</p>
<h2 id="c6">EVIDENCE FOR AN INSULAR VERSION OF THE ROMANCE</h2>
<p class="bq">The whole character of the earlier <i>Lancelot</i> story is
strongly reminiscent of a <i>lai</i>, and I see no reason to
depart from the opinion expressed in my <i>Lancelot</i>
&lsquo;Studies,&rsquo; that the root of the whole wonderful growth
is to be sought in such a <i>lai</i>.</p>
<p class="bq">Nor do I see reason to doubt that this <i>lai</i> may have
been of continental origin, and at the same time have
taken this most important step in development upon
insular ground. I cannot agree with those scholars who
appear to regard the Channel as an impassable barrier
to communication previous to the date of Chr&eacute;tien de
Troyes, and the most facile medium of intercourse
immediately after that date!</p>
<p class="bq">For more than a century previous, <i>i.e.</i> from the days
of Edward the Confessor, intercourse between the
English court and the north of France had been
frequent and continuous; for nearly a century the
kings of England had also been princes of France.
When, therefore, we find, as we do, that the materials
for the development of a story existed on both sides of
the Channel, and that the story, in its completed form,
is akin to both continental and insular variants, forming,
as it were, a link between the two, and combining
forms which are not known to meet elsewhere, the
conclusion that the process of evolution was not confined
to one country appears neither illogical nor
unfounded.</p>
<p class="bq">I would, therefore, now suggest that we have solid
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
grounds for supposing that the story of Lancelot,
starting as a Breton <i>lai</i>, and brought in that form to
England, became in these islands connected with a
special variant of a very widely diffused folk-tale.
Having borrowed from this tale certain adventures,
it found its way back, in this enlarged form, to the
Continent, where the story from which it had borrowed
being equally well known, it underwent further development
on the same lines. I suspect that here the
flying horses of the Celtic tale became transformed
into the normal steeds of the Three Days&rsquo; Tournament,
though the colour of the armour&mdash;green, red, and
white&mdash;was at first retained.</p>
<p class="bq">But on which side of the Channel was the final
and most important step, the incorporation with the
Arthurian cycle, taken? Of the various versions of
Guinevere&rsquo;s abduction, the Melwas story exists only in
an insular text, the <i>Vita Gild&aelig;</i>, and this is apparently
connected with a partly lost and entirely confused
Welsh tradition. The Meleagant version is by
locality directly connected with Melwas; and the only
extant version of the Faler&icirc;n abduction tale came
from England. I submit that here again we have
reasonable ground for the hypothesis that the identification
of Lancelot as Guinevere&rsquo;s rescuer, and subsequently
as her lover, may be due to insular rather than
continental development. The question is, as will be
seen, by no means an easy one, and I should prefer to
express no definite opinion as to the real bearing of
the evidence here adduced. There are, as I have shown,
indications pointing in opposite directions. The precise
value and relation of these indications will be better
realised as we become more familiar with what is at present
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
a somewhat novel interpretation of the facts. In
any case it will be seen that the theory here advanced
only affects the earlier stages of the <i>Lancelot</i> story,
leaving untouched the question of its development
as part of the Arthurian romantic cycle. It affords us
a working hypothesis which may enable us to bridge
the gulf between Lancelot the independent hero
(<i>Lanzelet</i>) and Lancelot the queen&rsquo;s lover (<i>Charrette</i>), a
gulf which has hitherto presented a problem baffling
to the Arthurian student.</p>
<p class="bq">But is it not also apparent that, in the light of the
evidence here collected, the theory of an Anglo-Norman
Arthurian tradition, independent of, and
anterior to, Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s poems should no longer be
contemptuously derided? Whatever may be the
eventual verdict on the evolution of the <i>Lancelot</i> story,
the examination of the various romantic versions of
the Tournament story, in the light of folk-lore evidence,
has, I think, made absolutely clear to any
unprejudiced critic that the <i>Clig&eacute;s</i> version cannot
possibly be the source of either the <i>Lanzelet</i> or the
<i>Ipomedon</i>, but represents a version further removed
from the original form, and in all probability dependent
upon some variant, or variants, of the <i>Lancelot</i>.
And if this be the case in one poem, and that the very
poem in which the admirers of Chr&eacute;tien assert roundly
that his independence is most clearly shown, are we
not justified in our hesitation as regards his other
works?</p>
<p class="bq">In my <i>Lancelot</i> &lsquo;Studies&rsquo; I showed that Professor
Foerster&rsquo;s theory as to the origin of the <i>Yvain</i> would
not bear the test of strict examination; that evidence,
both internal and external, could be adduced in favour
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of the view that the tale was but a collection of <i>lais</i>,
put together and worked over by others before
Chr&eacute;tien gave the final touch which converted them
into a literary whole. Before long I hope to show,
what I have recently recognised as a fact capable of
demonstration, that the <i>Perceval</i> &lsquo;<i>Enfances</i>,&rsquo; so far
from being the source of the other versions, is but an
incomplete and inferior version of a story, which in its
original and perfect form no longer exists, but is
better preserved elsewhere. <i>Erec</i>, so far, I have not
examined, but I have little doubt that the result of
careful investigation will here be the same; certain it
is that the initial adventure, the chase of a fairy stag,
represents a superstition alive in these islands to
this day. The trackers on Dartmoor claim to be able
to distinguish the &lsquo;slot&rsquo; of the fairy deer from among
all others, and will solemnly warn the huntsmen of the
futility of following such a trail.</p>
<p class="bq">Those of us, and they are many, who entertain a
profound respect, not merely for M. Gaston Paris&rsquo;
learning, but also for his keen critical instinct, and
what I can best express as &lsquo;sense of atmosphere,&rsquo; have
hesitated, even though little evidence appeared to be
forthcoming, to dismiss lightly, not to say discourteously,
a theory which had the support of his
authority; the foregoing pages will, I hope, show
grounds for believing that an investigation, conducted
perhaps on somewhat different lines to those hitherto
in favour, will fully justify this hesitation.</p>
<p class="bq">We are only on the threshold of Arthurian criticism,
and till we have thoroughly familiarised ourselves
with the elementary conditions of the problem before
us, it is both premature and unscientific to expect to
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
obtain in any section of this wide field a result which
can be claimed as permanent. Thoroughness is an
admirable quality; but the thoroughness which consists
in carefully and microscopically surveying a
single part, before we have ascertained the relation
of that part to the whole, is only too apt to result in
throwing that whole hopelessly out of focus. The
time has not yet come when a final study of any part
of the Arthurian legend, based upon a comparison of
all the texts, is possible or indeed desirable. The
different threads that form the shifting pattern of
the fabric are so interwoven that no one can as yet
be disentangled <i>beyond a certain point</i> without injury
to the whole.</p>
<p class="bq">Thus neither the <i>Gawain</i>, the <i>Perceval</i>, nor the
<i>Lancelot</i> stories can at the present moment receive
satisfactory and <i>final</i> treatment. In the advanced
stages of Arthurian legendary development these three
main lines of tradition have become so entangled,
have crossed and complicated each other to such an
extent, that it is only by following what we may call
a parallel method of study that we can hope to determine
their exact relationship to each other; while
until that exact relationship be accurately determined,
a scientific study of the cycle, as a whole, is impossible.
There appear to me to be three possible
lines of investigation, any one of which will probably
throw light on the other two; while the results to be
obtained from all three would go far towards providing
a sound and scientific basis for future inquiries. These
three are (<i>a</i>) The various versions of the Gawain Grail
quest; absolutely necessary if we desire to understand
the development of the Grail section of the cycle.
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
(<i>b</i>) The <i>Perceval</i> continuations; which contain sections
belonging to early and non-cyclic versions of the
stories affected, combined with sections drawn from
later and cyclic redactions. These texts will also throw
light upon the small and interesting cycle of the <i>Bel
Inconnu</i>, which is connected with all the three lines of
tradition, and is important for all. (<i>c</i>) A comparative
study of the various <i>Lancelot</i> versions, which will
enable us to disentangle the earlier <i>Perceval-Lancelot</i>
redactions from the later <i>Galahad</i> development.</p>
<p class="bq">But in this investigation there are certain principles
which must be kept clearly in view. We must
remember that a cycle like the Arthurian cycle, compounded
largely of what we may call mythical and
imaginative elements, and largely devoid of historical
basis, cannot be examined and criticised on the same
principles and by the same methods as can the
Charlemagne cycle, where historic conditions, though
modified for romantic purposes, have controlled and
shaped the process of development.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<p class="bq">In this latter case an appeal to documentary evidence,
and a criticism conducted largely on literary
lines, is, by nature of the material to be dealt with,
entirely in its place; in the former, inasmuch as the
material of which it is composed belongs far less to
history than to that indefinable body we call popular
tradition, which never finds more than partial expression
in literature, and yet maintains its character
practically unchanged throughout the centuries, we
must follow a different method.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p class="bq">Not that the historic element is to be neglected; far
from it. On the contrary, I would urge that greater
attention be bestowed on certain historic factors than
has hitherto been the case. The Arthurian romances
do not, as do the Charlemagne, reflect more or less
correctly certain facts, or periods of history, but the
circumstances and surroundings of their origin may
nevertheless have been more or less determined by
historic conditions, <i>i.e.</i> the influence exercised by the
court and policy of Henry <span class="small">II</span>.</p>
<p class="bq">We are perfectly well aware that a feature of that
monarch&rsquo;s domestic policy was his desire to conciliate
the Welsh by a clever use of their popular traditions.
The alleged discovery of King Arthur&rsquo;s tomb at
Glastonbury was, as most historians now recognise,
merely an ingenious move in the political game. To
what extent he carried his encouragement and adoption
of Arthurian tradition we have perhaps hardly yet
realised. The fact that it was possible to publish in
1167 a correspondence purporting to be between the
King and Arthur in Avalon shows that if Henry did
not directly encourage the forgery, he at least saw no
ground for discouraging it, and was willing to play
into the hands of any one furthering this special line
of conciliation. We know, as a matter of literary
evidence, that the manuscripts of a very large section
of Arthurian prose romance attribute their composition
to the direct command of the king; but so
far we have not attempted to ascertain the precise
value to be placed on this recurring testimony.
I believe myself that a careful investigation into
the literary patronage exercised by Henry, and his
interest in Arthurian traditions, would yield results
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
somewhat disconcerting to the adherents of the Continental
School.</p>
<p class="bq">Of the value of folk-lore and folk-tale as witnesses
in the case of a group of stories based largely upon
popular tradition, and in their earlier stages of evolution
the property of popular story-tellers, we are only
slowly becoming aware. But the study of story-transmission
has in these last years made immense
strides, and may now claim to be fairly based upon
sound scientific principles. The extent to which such
a study, accurately and carefully carried on, may
reflect light upon allied subjects, such as the Arthurian
cycle, has yet to be realised. It may be hoped that
these pages will lend encouragement to the following
up of this special line of investigation.</p>
<p class="bq">But there is a danger in our path. Admiration for
the learning and indefatigable industry of German
scholars has, I fear, caused too many of us to erect
into a fetich the result of their labours, and to hold
ourselves thereby absolved from the toil of first-hand
investigation. This is to render no true service to the
cause of scholarship; no one man, no group of men,
may claim to be infallible. The result of recent
investigation into the value and correctness of Dr.
Sommer&rsquo;s <i>Studies on the Sources of Malory</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> a book
which for ten years past has been unhesitatingly
accepted in scholarly circles as a reliable authority,
should be an object lesson to all of us in the necessity
of caution, and the individual responsibility which
rests upon each to ascertain independently, so far as
it be possible, the correctness and solidity of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
ground upon which we found our arguments and our
conclusions.</p>
<p class="bq">Careful and systematic work, with, from time to
time, the revision and comparison of results, only to
be attained by publication, will, I believe, before very
long, enable us to place the criticism of the Arthurian
cycle upon a really satisfactory basis. At present it
is vain to hope that any one of us can produce, in this
particular line of literary investigation, a <i>magnum opus</i>
that shall be beyond the necessity of revision, and
sealed with the stamp of permanent and enduring
value.</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a>Professor Foerster&rsquo;s remark (<i>Charrette</i>, Introduction, p. xlvi), that
Hugo would, not improbably, take with him a copy of the last romance
which had created a popular <i>furore</i>, is one of those gratuitous assumptions
which, to the learned professor, assume the virtue of facts, but
which cannot be admitted, by any serious critic, as a contribution to
the argument. Professor Foerster seems to imagine a twelfth century
&lsquo;Mudie&rsquo; with a &lsquo;run&rsquo; on the latest novel! If the source of the <i>Lanzelet</i>
had created in any sense a <i>furore</i>, it would scarcely have disappeared so
completely. Considering the slowness of reproduction in those days, it
is at least as likely that the book was an old and valued favourite; but
as I said above, such hypotheses do not advance the question one way or
the other.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_29" href="#fr_29">[29]</a>I believe myself that the two works of the greatest importance for
determining the evolution of the Arthurian cycle are these lost French
sources of the <i>Lanzelet</i> and of the <i>Parzival</i>. It is not, I think, impossible
that fragments at least may remain entombed in some library. When their
importance is more generally recognised there may perhaps be an organised
attempt made at their discovery.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_30" href="#fr_30">[30]</a>I have not seen either of these German fragments. Professor
Foerster&rsquo;s tendency to claim as Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s undoubted property everything
that even remotely resembles the work of the French poet makes
caution needful. I give the statement entirely upon his authority. With
regard to the passage in the <i>Parzival</i>, Book <span class="small">XII.</span> l. 116, <i>et seq.</i>, at first
sight it seems clearly to refer to Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s poem; but, as Professor
Foerster himself admits, the work clearly consists of two sections, and it
seems quite possible that the first part, the story of Alexander and Soredamors,
may have been known independently. As the testimony of the
<i>Perceval</i> poems proves, there was current a love story connected with a
sister of Gawain. The weak point in this <i>Parzival</i> allusion is, that the
poet is recalling the torments that Gawain and his kin have suffered
through &lsquo;<i>Minne</i>.&rsquo; Now the love story of Clig&eacute;s and Phenice is far more
tragic than that of Clig&eacute;s&rsquo; parents; and it is difficult to understand why,
if the writer knew the <i>whole</i> poem, he should refer only to the weaker
illustration, as both are equally connected with Gawain. I suspect myself
that the allusion was in Wolfram&rsquo;s source, and refers to the source of the
<i>Clig&eacute;s</i>.

two &lsquo;triplets&rsquo; of colours are also to be met with elsewhere. Thus black,
white, and red are found, as we have seen, in a famous incident of the
<i>Perceval</i>; and that curious book, <i>Durandus on Symbolism</i>, gives them as
the colours of the three veils covering the altar at Passiontide. White,
green, and red are found in the legend of the Tree of Life, and Solomon&rsquo;s
Ship, preserved in the <i>Queste</i> and <i>Grand Saint Graal</i>. A friend, learned
in such matters, has informed me that these sets of colours represent
certain alchemical processes, and in that connection were well known in
medi&aelig;val times. It seems possible that there may have been some
hidden and mystical significance attached to their earliest use; we have
not fathomed all the secrets of folk-lore.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_60" href="#fr_60">[60]</a>I would draw the attention of students of the <i>Lais</i> of Marie de
France to the fact that Map gives several versions of the wedding of a
knight with a fairy, or Otherworld, mistress. Also a version of a visit
to the Otherworld kingdom with an ending closely corresponding with
that of the <i>Voyage of Bran</i>, and <i>Guingamor</i>, and in each case he locates
the story in Wales. It is perfectly clear that tales, such as we find in the
<i>Lais</i>, were at least as well known in these islands as on the Continent.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_66" href="#fr_66">[66]</a>The theory which I advanced in chap. vii. of the <i>Legend of Sir
Lancelot</i> with regard to the temporary disappearance of the tradition of
Guinevere&rsquo;s infidelity is, I think, strengthened by the evidence of the
various &lsquo;chastity-test&rsquo; <i>Lais</i>, Horn, Mantle, Glove. We might reasonably
expect Guinevere to come but poorly out of such an ordeal; as a rule,
however, she escapes very easily, far more easily, indeed, than the
majority of the ladies of the court. In one case we are clearly given to
understand that her sole error, a trivial one, has been one of thought.
Now the <i>lais</i> represent, as is generally admitted, an early stage of
romantic evolution, and taken into consideration with the evidence of the
earlier poems, they certainly appear to strengthen the argument tentatively
put forward in my <i>Lancelot</i>, <i>e.g.</i> that the tradition of the queen&rsquo;s faithlessness
to her husband belonged to the <i>historic</i> legend and was, as such,
preserved in the pseudo-chronicles; it had no existence in the <i>romantic</i>
legend till introduced under the influence of a special social condition,
and in this its later form, it is not to be regarded as a survival of the
historic Modred story, but as a later and independent development.
